# Telegram APIs

We offer two kinds of APIs for developers. The [**Bot API**](https://core.telegram.org/api#bot-api) allows you to easily create programs that use Telegram messages for an interface. The [**Telegram API and TDLib**](https://core.telegram.org/api#tdlib-build-your-own-telegram) allow you to build your own customized Telegram clients. You are welcome to use both APIs free of charge.

You can also add [**Telegram Widgets**](https://core.telegram.org/widgets) to your website.

Designers are welcome to create [**Animated Stickers**](https://core.telegram.org/animated_stickers) or [**Custom Themes**](https://core.telegram.org/themes) for Telegram.

### Bot API

This API allows you to connect bots to our system. [**Telegram Bots**](https://core.telegram.org/bots) are special accounts that do not require an additional phone number to set up. These accounts serve as an interface for code running somewhere on your server.

To use this, you don't need to know anything about how our MTProto encryption protocol works — our intermediary server will handle all encryption and communication with the Telegram API for you. You communicate with this server via a simple HTTPS-interface that offers a simplified version of the Telegram API.

Bot developers can also make use of our [**Payments API**](https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments) to accept **payments** from Telegram users around the world.

### TDLib – build your own Telegram

Even if you're looking for maximum customization, you don't have to create your app from scratch. Try our [**Telegram Database Library**](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib) (or simply TDLib), a tool for third-party developers that makes it easy to build fast, secure and feature-rich Telegram apps.

TDLib takes care of all **network implementation** details, **encryption** and **local data storage**, so that you can dedicate more time to design, responsive interfaces and beautiful animations.

TDLib supports all Telegram features and makes developing Telegram apps a breeze on any platform. It can be used on Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux and virtually any other system. The library is open source and compatible with virtually **any programming language**.
